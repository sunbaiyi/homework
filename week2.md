   Through learning character 4，I'm intrested in the spiral model.I read some information about it.
I find out that the spiral model is a risk-driven process model generator for software projects. 
Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements
of one or more process models, such as incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototyping.

   four basic activities in every cycle:
This invariant identifies the four basic activities that must occur in each cycle of the spiral model:
1.Consider the win conditions of all success-critical stakeholders.
2.Identify and evaluate alternative approaches for satisfying the win conditions.
3.Identify and resolve risks that stem from the selected approach(es).
4.Obtain approval from all success-critical stakeholders, plus commitment to pursue the next cycle.

  The primary advantage of spiral model is it's range of options accommodates the good features of exiting software
process models,while it's risk-driven approach avoids many of their difficulties.

  Through learning character 5，I think it's hard to become a senior software QA engineer,at first I think
  a QA engineer' job is testing a product,and lists the bugs.Now I realize that to be a senior software QA engineer is as 
difficult as to be a senior software engineer and the market is very lack of senior software QA engineer.
  It's promising to be a QA engineer.
  It's another way of our career.
